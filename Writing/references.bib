  abstract = {This thesis addresses the subject of formation control of underwater vehicles, using either inter-vehicle relative position measurements or range-only measurements. The work is motivated by the MORPH project, aiming to use formations of vehicles with complementary capabilities to map the underwater environment in challenging conditions. The problem studied is that of driving a vehicle (follower) to an appropriately defined position with respect to another vehicle (leader), which moves along an unknown trajectory. This control task is divided into two steps. Firstly, a trajectory-tracking controller is designed, so that a follower vehicle can track a specified virtual target. Conditions under which the tracking error converges to zero or remains bounded are derived using tools from nonlinear systems theory. Secondly, we design path-generators that provide the position and velocity of the virtual target to be tracked, for both the relative position measurements and the range-only measurements scenarios. These path-generation strategies take into account the formation objectives, typical maneuver geometries and limitations of underwater inter-vehicle communications. Applications envisioned in the scope of the MORPH project are presented and discussed. The implementation of the strategies proposed for formation control with relative position measurements is described, taking explicitly into account the filter architectures required for relative vehicle navigation. Finally, results of simulations and sea trials are shown, with position errors generally below 1 m in MORPH trials in Lisbon and the Azores.},

  abstract = {This research examines the prominent role of sonar technology, especially the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), in the determination of ship velocity. The DVL employs a four-beam Janus configuration to measure a ship's velocity relative to the waterbed by transmitting acoustic pulses along different azimuth-oriented beams. The study focuses on a scenario where a ship moving through a waterbed produces a Doppler frequency shift, a critical parameter for determining the ship velocity. This paper presents a thorough comparison between the correlation-based broad-band pulse-pair method and the narrow-band least squares method for the determination of Doppler frequency shift. The selection of these methods dynamically adapts to varying water depths. The algorithms are developed and simulated in MATLAB, followed by implementation in Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and further validated through trials in diverse water bodies. Results indicate the broad-band pulse-pair method excelling in low-depth scenarios, while the narrow-band least squares algorithm performs optimally in higher depths. Dynamic algorithm switching based on the water depth exhibits an adaptive approach, enhancing the accuracy of Doppler shift estimations. This study contributes valuable insights for optimizing DVL frequency estimation, providing a practical solution for underwater navigation across varying depth conditions.},

The filter uses the predictor---corrector structure, with prediction based on gyroscopes and independent correction steps for acceleration and magnetic field sensors. We propose two variants of the filter: (i) one using mathematical operations of special orthogonal group SO(3), that are accurate for nonlinear operations, for highest possible accuracy, and (ii) one using linearization of nonlinear operations for fast evaluation. Both approaches are quaternion-based filter realizations without redundant steps. The filters are compared to state of the art methods in this field on data recorded using low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors with ground truth measured by the VICON optical system. Both filters achieved better accuracy than conventional methods at lower computational cost. The recorded data with ground truth reference and the source codes of both filters are publicly available.},

  abstract = {This article describes principles of motion sensors data fusion. We analyze various methods of inertial sensors fusion to ensure more accurate and reliable measurements by using the benefits of multiple sensors to eliminate their individual weaknesses. An Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) provides 3D orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw) of a moving object (car, aircraft, drone, etc.) with position and heading information. For implementation of a low cost AHRS system Micro-Electrical-Mechanical System (MEMS) based sensors were used (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer). Accelerometers suffer from errors caused by external accelerations that add up to gravity and, such errors make accelerometers-based rotation inaccurate. Gyroscopes can compensate for such errors, but they also create drifting problems. The direction of the measured Earth magnetic field (magnetometer) is used as a (3D) compass to determine the direction of the North (heading or yaw). A locally disturbed (warped) magnetic field causes an error in orientation that can be quite substantial. So, for the precise data additionally three very common and well-known filters were introduced to the system: moving average filter, complementary and Kalman filters. In this paper a comparison of system performance is shown separately, so that the filter with the best performance can be chosen for a specific system. In the practical part we use Xsens Mti-20 inertial measurement unit. Three sensors' data processing and filtering methods are presented: Kalman filter, moving average filter and complimentary filter. The moving average filter provides simple data filtering by averaging within a window of specified length, while the complimentary filter performs fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope data by calculating pitch and roll angles. In order to evaluate the performance of each filter, measurements were made in real time for a moving vehicle.},

The method employs a new concept of sine rotation vector and uses both an attitude heading and reference system (AHRS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for the purpose of measurement. First, the acceleration and magnetic-field measurements are transformed into sine rotation vectors and combined. The combined sine rotation vector is then transformed into the differences between the Euler angles of the measured attitude and the predicted attitude; the differences are used to correct the predicted attitude. The method was evaluated according to field-test data and simulation data and compared to existing methods that calculate angular differences directly without a preceding sine rotation vector transformation. The comparison verifies that the proposed method improves the attitude estimation performance.},

  abstract = {In strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation, the DVL is utilized to restrain the error accumulation of SINS. When operating in mid-water zone, the DVL may lose bottom track due to the limited sensor range. In this case, its measurements will be affected by sea currents. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel current compensation method for SINS/DVL integrated navigation. Based on a new technical route, the proposed method removes the constraints of the existing methods. It is developed as follows. By applying the DVL measurements in the acoustic Doppler current profiler mode, a current measurement module is established to operate in parallel with the SINS/DVL integrated navigation system. On this basis, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is designed for current compensation. Specifically, when the DVL operates normally, it can simultaneously output the earth-relative and water-relative velocities. The earth-relative velocity is applied for integrated navigation. Meanwhile, it is applied to train the RBF neural network along with the water-relative velocity. Therefore, the RBF neural network approximates the function between the earth-relative and water-relative velocities. When the DVL loses bottom track, the well-trained RBF neural network can be utilized as a velocity predictor. By inputting the water-relative velocity from DVL, it can predict the earth-relative velocity for integrated navigation. In this way, the current compensation is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by realistic semi-physical experiments.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) have been used over the past 40 years on moving vessels in river and ocean environments to remotely measure, along the path of the vessel, the vessel relative velocity to 1) the water versus depth (current profiles) and 2) the bottom (bottom tracking) to produce earth referenced velocity profiles by subtracting the two measurements to remove the vessel speed from the current profiles. These ADCPs typically employ four narrow, downward slanting single-frequency acoustic beams pointing in orthogonal directions (referred to as Janus configuration beams). These beam sets are produced by either 4 separate inclined circular piston transducers, or a single flat two-dimensional phased array transducer which utilizes the full aperture for all 4 beams, and thus has a factor of two smaller diameter. Typical operation is at a single frequency within the range of 38 to 1200 kHz. Lower frequency ADCP transducers achieve longer profiling, but with lower depth, velocity and time resolution. Higher frequency ADCP transducers achieve shorter range profiling, but with higher depth, velocity and time resolution. Thus, a performance compromise decision must be made for each vessel installation. In this paper, a new ADCP with a multi-frequency phased array transducer using two frequencies of 38 and 300 kHz is presented, which enables simultaneous measurement high resolution current profiles in the more dynamic upper ocean or shallow water ({$<$}300 m), and, by correlating 38 and 300 kHz measurements, improved velocity resolution measurements in the deep ocean of up to 1500 m. Results are presented as a function of range and velocity measurements for the multi-frequency phased array transducers operated at two different frequencies.},

In the solar wind, beyond Earth's magnetic influence, the magnetic field is relatively low and less fluctuating. In contrast, the magnetosheath --- the region between the bow shock and the magnetopause --- is characterized by significantly more turbulent magnetic fields. Within the magnetosphere, the magnetic field can go up to tens of thousands of nanotesla 5 (nT). Traditionally, fluxgate magnetometers have been the standard instrument for space-based magnetic field measurements. However, in recent years, alternative technologies such as anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors and optically pumped magnetometers have been proposed and, in some cases, deployed. This study compares the noise performances of two magnetometers, a fluxgate and an AMR, by evaluating their amplitude spectral density measurements across various near--Earth regions of space. The potential of each sensor type for investigating specific phenomena is also evaluated.},

Our approach employs relative angular position measurements to estimate the three-axis magnetometer measurement bias, significantly improving magnetometer-based attitude estimation. Relative angular position measurements can be calculated from a variety of sources, including multiview image registration or laser-based scan matching. We report two methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares and a real-time discrete Kalman filter. Compared with previously reported methods our approach is time independent and less restrictive with data sampling. In addition, our two methods (i) are empirically shown to impose less restrictive conditions for the movements of the instrument required for calibration, (ii) do not require knowledge of the direction of the field (e.g., the local magnetic field) or the attitude of the instrument, and (iii) also ensure convergence for the estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared with previously reported methods in both numerical simulation and in comparative experimental evaluation using cameras and magnetometer sensors under different conditions.},

The hydrodynamic parameters and thruster model have been validated in a test facility. The benchmark model also includes the ocean current, modeled as constant velocity. The tether connecting the ROV to the top-site facility has been modeled using the lumped mass method and is implemented as a force input to the ROV model. At last, to show the usefulness of the benchmark model, a case study is presented where a BlueROV2 is deployed to inspect an offshore monopile structure. The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error.

The BlueROV2 model is based on Fossen's equations and includes a kinematic model of the vehicle, the hydrodynamics of vehicle and water interaction, a dynamic model of the thrusters, and, lastly, the gravitational/buoyant forces. The hydrodynamic parameters and thruster model have been validated in a test facility. The benchmark model also includes the ocean current, modeled as constant velocity. The tether connecting the ROV to the top-site facility has been modeled using the lumped mass method and is implemented as a force input to the ROV model. At last, to show the usefulness of the benchmark model, a case study is presented where a BlueROV2 is deployed to inspect an offshore monopile structure. The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error. It is concluded that the simulator establishes a benchmark for future control schemes for position control and trajectory tracking under the influence of environmental disturbances.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly important for different types of industrial applications. The generally high cost of AUVs restricts the access to them and therefore advances in research and technological development. However, recent advances have led to lower cost commercially available Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which present a platform that can be enhanced to enable a high degree of autonomy, similar to that of a high-end AUV. In this article, we present how a low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf ROV can be used as a foundation for developing versatile and affordable AUVs. We introduce the required hardware modifications to obtain a system capable of autonomous operations as well as the necessary software modules. Additionally, we present a set of use cases exhibiting the versatility of the developed platform for intervention and mapping tasks.},
