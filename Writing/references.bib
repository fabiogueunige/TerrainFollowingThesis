  abstract = {This thesis addresses the subject of formation control of underwater vehicles, using either inter-vehicle relative position measurements or range-only measurements. The work is motivated by the MORPH project, aiming to use formations of vehicles with complementary capabilities to map the underwater environment in challenging conditions. The problem studied is that of driving a vehicle (follower) to an appropriately defined position with respect to another vehicle (leader), which moves along an unknown trajectory. This control task is divided into two steps. Firstly, a trajectory-tracking controller is designed, so that a follower vehicle can track a specified virtual target. Conditions under which the tracking error converges to zero or remains bounded are derived using tools from nonlinear systems theory. Secondly, we design path-generators that provide the position and velocity of the virtual target to be tracked, for both the relative position measurements and the range-only measurements scenarios. These path-generation strategies take into account the formation objectives, typical maneuver geometries and limitations of underwater inter-vehicle communications. Applications envisioned in the scope of the MORPH project are presented and discussed. The implementation of the strategies proposed for formation control with relative position measurements is described, taking explicitly into account the filter architectures required for relative vehicle navigation. Finally, results of simulations and sea trials are shown, with position errors generally below 1 m in MORPH trials in Lisbon and the Azores.},

  abstract = {This research examines the prominent role of sonar technology, especially the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), in the determination of ship velocity. The DVL employs a four-beam Janus configuration to measure a ship's velocity relative to the waterbed by transmitting acoustic pulses along different azimuth-oriented beams. The study focuses on a scenario where a ship moving through a waterbed produces a Doppler frequency shift, a critical parameter for determining the ship velocity. This paper presents a thorough comparison between the correlation-based broad-band pulse-pair method and the narrow-band least squares method for the determination of Doppler frequency shift. The selection of these methods dynamically adapts to varying water depths. The algorithms are developed and simulated in MATLAB, followed by implementation in Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and further validated through trials in diverse water bodies. Results indicate the broad-band pulse-pair method excelling in low-depth scenarios, while the narrow-band least squares algorithm performs optimally in higher depths. Dynamic algorithm switching based on the water depth exhibits an adaptive approach, enhancing the accuracy of Doppler shift estimations. This study contributes valuable insights for optimizing DVL frequency estimation, providing a practical solution for underwater navigation across varying depth conditions.},

  abstract = {Learning-based adaptive control methods hold the premise of enabling autonomous agents to reduce the effect of process variations with minimal human intervention. However, its application to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has so far been restricted due to 1) unknown dynamics under the form of sea current disturbance that we can not model properly nor measure due to limited sensor capability and 2) the nonlinearity of AUVs tasks where the controller response at some operating points must be overly conservative in order to satisfy the specification at other operating points. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can alleviates these limitations by training generalpurpose neural network policies, but applications of DRL algorithms to AUVs have been restricted to simulated environments, due to their inherent high sample complexity and distribution shift problem. This paper presents a novel approach, merging the Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with a classic model-based control architecture, to formulate an adaptive controller. Within this framework, we introduce a Sim-to-Real transfer strategy comprising the following components: a bio-inspired experience replay mechanism, an enhanced domain randomisation technique, and an evaluation protocol executed on a physical platform. Our experimental assessments demonstrate that this method effectively learns proficient policies from suboptimal simulated models of the AUV, resulting in control performance 3 times higher when transferred to a real-world vehicle, compared to its model-based nonadaptive but optimal counterpart.},

This paper proposes a line survey method for USBL angular alignment calibration. In the scheme of USBL line survey, mathematical representations of positioning error arising from heading, pitch and roll misalignments are derived, respectively. The effect of each misalignment angle and how the differences can be used to calibrate each misalignment angle in turn are presented. An iterative algorithm that takes advantage of the geometry of position errors resulting from angular misalignments is developed for USBL calibration. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the USBL line survey approach. In addition, the effect of measurement error on the estimation of roll alignment error is evaluated and discussed.},

  abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regularly used for deep ocean applications. Commonly, the autonomous navigation task is carried out by a fusion between two sensors: the inertial navigation system and the Doppler velocity log (DVL). The DVL operates by transmitting four acoustic beams to the sea floor, and once reflected back, the AUV velocity vector can be estimated. However, in real-life scenarios, such as an uneven seabed, sea creatures blocking the DVL's view and, roll/pitch maneuvers, the acoustic beams' reflection is resulting in a scenario known as DVL outage. Consequently, a velocity update is not available to bind the inertial solution drift. To cope with such situations, in this paper, we leverage our BeamsNet framework and propose a Set-Transformer-based BeamsNet (ST-BeamsNet) that utilizes inertial data readings and previous DVL velocity measurements to regress the current AUV velocity in case of a complete DVL outage. The proposed approach was evaluated using data from experiments held in the Mediterranean Sea with the Snapir AUV and was compared to a moving average (MA) estimator. Our ST-BeamsNet estimated the AUV velocity vector with an 8.547\% speed error, which is 26\% better than the MA approach.},

Based on the waypoint-based path planning, our approach provides a set of optimal waypoints by following which a cruising AUV accomplishes an effectual nearbottom flight avoiding bottom collision. In deriving our waypoints, we solve an optimization problem. The problem formulation employs the performance index as a metric for the deviation between the AUV flight trajectory and the along-track altitude envelope of a terrain. An inequality constraint of the minimum allowable altitude is incorporated into our optimization. Moreover, considering the motion-constrained characteristics of a dynamic system, a state--space model describing the motion of a specific vehicle is also incorporated into the optimization. As the solution procedure a GDS-based search algorithm is used. By applying the algorithm, the optimal reference depths of the waypoints predefined within a horizontal plane are obtained. Being a depthbased control approach providing superior angular motion stability, our pseudo-terrain-following navigation is particularly suited to acoustic bottom mapping and imaging. The feasibility and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated through the application of optimal waypoints to an actual near-bottom survey mission using our cruising AUV.},

  abstract = {This article describes principles of motion sensors data fusion. We analyze various methods of inertial sensors fusion to ensure more accurate and reliable measurements by using the benefits of multiple sensors to eliminate their individual weaknesses. An Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) provides 3D orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw) of a moving object (car, aircraft, drone, etc.) with position and heading information. For implementation of a low cost AHRS system Micro-Electrical-Mechanical System (MEMS) based sensors were used (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer). Accelerometers suffer from errors caused by external accelerations that add up to gravity and, such errors make accelerometers-based rotation inaccurate. Gyroscopes can compensate for such errors, but they also create drifting problems. The direction of the measured Earth magnetic field (magnetometer) is used as a (3D) compass to determine the direction of the North (heading or yaw). A locally disturbed (warped) magnetic field causes an error in orientation that can be quite substantial. So, for the precise data additionally three very common and well-known filters were introduced to the system: moving average filter, complementary and Kalman filters. In this paper a comparison of system performance is shown separately, so that the filter with the best performance can be chosen for a specific system. In the practical part we use Xsens Mti-20 inertial measurement unit. Three sensors' data processing and filtering methods are presented: Kalman filter, moving average filter and complimentary filter. The moving average filter provides simple data filtering by averaging within a window of specified length, while the complimentary filter performs fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope data by calculating pitch and roll angles. In order to evaluate the performance of each filter, measurements were made in real time for a moving vehicle.},

The method employs a new concept of sine rotation vector and uses both an attitude heading and reference system (AHRS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for the purpose of measurement. First, the acceleration and magnetic-field measurements are transformed into sine rotation vectors and combined. The combined sine rotation vector is then transformed into the differences between the Euler angles of the measured attitude and the predicted attitude; the differences are used to correct the predicted attitude. The method was evaluated according to field-test data and simulation data and compared to existing methods that calculate angular differences directly without a preceding sine rotation vector transformation. The comparison verifies that the proposed method improves the attitude estimation performance.},

When operating in mid-water zone, the DVL may lose bottom track due to the limited sensor range. In this case, its measurements will be affected by sea currents. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel current compensation method for SINS/DVL integrated navigation. Based on a new technical route, the proposed method removes the constraints of the existing methods. It is developed as follows. By applying the DVL measurements in the acoustic Doppler current profiler mode, a current measurement module is established to operate in parallel with the SINS/DVL integrated navigation system. On this basis, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is designed for current compensation. Specifically, when the DVL operates normally, it can simultaneously output the earth-relative and water-relative velocities. The earth-relative velocity is applied for integrated navigation. Meanwhile, it is applied to train the RBF neural network along with the water-relative velocity. Therefore, the RBF neural network approximates the function between the earth-relative and water-relative velocities. When the DVL loses bottom track, the well-trained RBF neural network can be utilized as a velocity predictor. By inputting the water-relative velocity from DVL, it can predict the earth-relative velocity for integrated navigation. In this way, the current compensation is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by realistic semi-physical experiments.},

  abstract = {In an increasing number of scientific and commercial mission scenarios at sea, it is required to simultaneously localize a group of underwater targets. The latter may include moored systems, autonomous vehicles, and even human divers. For reasons that have to do with the unavailability of Global Positioning System underwater, cost reduction, and simplicity of operation, there is currently a surge of interest in the development of range-based multiple target localization systems that rely on the computation of the distances between the targets and a number of sensor nodes deployed at the ocean surface, equipped with acoustic range measuring devices. In the case of a single target, there is a wealth of literature on the problem of optimal acoustic sensor placement to maximize the information available for target localization using trilateration methods. In the case of multiple targets, however, the literature is scarce. Motivated by these considerations, we address the problem of optimal sensor placement for multiple underwater target positioning. In this setup, we are naturally led to a multiple objective optimization problem, the solution of which allows for the analysis of the trade-offs involved in the localization of the targets simultaneously. To this end, we resort to tools from estimation theory and multi-objective optimization. For each target, the function to be minimized (by proper choice of the sensor configuration) is related to the determinant of the corresponding Fisher information matrix, which yields information on the minimum possible covariance of the error with which the position of the target can be estimated using any non-biased estimator. To deal with the fact that more than one target is involved, we exploit the concept of multiple objective Pareto-optimal solutions to characterize the best possible accuracy with which each of the targets can be positioned, given constraints on the desired positioning accuracy of the other targets. Simulation examples illustrate how, for a three-sensor network and two targets, it is possible to define an optimal sensor configuration that yields large positioning accuracy for both targets simultaneously, using convex optimization tools. When more than two targets are involved, however, more than three sensors are required to exploit an adequate trade-off of the accuracy with which each target can be positioned by resorting to non-convex and Pareto-optimization tools. We show how in this case the optimal sensor configurations depend on the Pareto weights assigned to each of the targets, as well as on the number of sensors, the number of targets, and the uncertainty with which the positions of the targets are known a priori.},

The advancement of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has allowed for unprecedented levels of exploration, monitoring, and study. AUVs are increasingly widely utilized for long missions, but because of water currents and oceanic complexity, they have difficulty maintaining an accurate position over a wider operational region. As a result, AUVs need more advanced navigational systems. However, the degradation of GPS and radio signals makes underwater navigation difficult. In this work of research, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with an inertial navigation system (INS) is proposed for precise location estimation of an AUV in three degrees of freedom (DOF). The EKF is used to simulate a sample of the INS accelerometer's data in the MATLAB environment to calculate position from acceleration, and the double integration technique of finding position is contrasted. The results of our experiments indicate that the suggested strategy yields better outcomes.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) have been used over the past 40 years on moving vessels in river and ocean environments to remotely measure, along the path of the vessel, the vessel relative velocity to 1) the water versus depth (current profiles) and 2) the bottom (bottom tracking) to produce earth referenced velocity profiles by subtracting the two measurements to remove the vessel speed from the current profiles. These ADCPs typically employ four narrow, downward slanting single-frequency acoustic beams pointing in orthogonal directions (referred to as Janus configuration beams). These beam sets are produced by either 4 separate inclined circular piston transducers, or a single flat two-dimensional phased array transducer which utilizes the full aperture for all 4 beams, and thus has a factor of two smaller diameter. Typical operation is at a single frequency within the range of 38 to 1200 kHz. Lower frequency ADCP transducers achieve longer profiling, but with lower depth, velocity and time resolution. Higher frequency ADCP transducers achieve shorter range profiling, but with higher depth, velocity and time resolution. Thus, a performance compromise decision must be made for each vessel installation. In this paper, a new ADCP with a multi-frequency phased array transducer using two frequencies of 38 and 300 kHz is presented, which enables simultaneous measurement high resolution current profiles in the more dynamic upper ocean or shallow water ({$<$}300 m), and, by correlating 38 and 300 kHz measurements, improved velocity resolution measurements in the deep ocean of up to 1500 m. Results are presented as a function of range and velocity measurements for the multi-frequency phased array transducers operated at two different frequencies.},

In the solar wind, beyond Earth's magnetic influence, the magnetic field is relatively low and less fluctuating. In contrast, the magnetosheath --- the region between the bow shock and the magnetopause --- is characterized by significantly more turbulent magnetic fields. Within the magnetosphere, the magnetic field can go up to tens of thousands of nanotesla 5 (nT). Traditionally, fluxgate magnetometers have been the standard instrument for space-based magnetic field measurements. However, in recent years, alternative technologies such as anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors and optically pumped magnetometers have been proposed and, in some cases, deployed. This study compares the noise performances of two magnetometers, a fluxgate and an AMR, by evaluating their amplitude spectral density measurements across various near--Earth regions of space. The potential of each sensor type for investigating specific phenomena is also evaluated.},

Our approach employs relative angular position measurements to estimate the three-axis magnetometer measurement bias, significantly improving magnetometer-based attitude estimation. Relative angular position measurements can be calculated from a variety of sources, including multiview image registration or laser-based scan matching. We report two methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares and a real-time discrete Kalman filter. Compared with previously reported methods our approach is time independent and less restrictive with data sampling. In addition, our two methods (i) are empirically shown to impose less restrictive conditions for the movements of the instrument required for calibration, (ii) do not require knowledge of the direction of the field (e.g., the local magnetic field) or the attitude of the instrument, and (iii) also ensure convergence for the estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared with previously reported methods in both numerical simulation and in comparative experimental evaluation using cameras and magnetometer sensors under different conditions.},

The hydrodynamic parameters and thruster model have been validated in a test facility. The benchmark model also includes the ocean current, modeled as constant velocity. The tether connecting the ROV to the top-site facility has been modeled using the lumped mass method and is implemented as a force input to the ROV model. At last, to show the usefulness of the benchmark model, a case study is presented where a BlueROV2 is deployed to inspect an offshore monopile structure. The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error.

  abstract = {This paper presents a simulation model environment for the popular and low-cost remotely operated vehicle (ROV) BlueROV2 implemented in Simulink™ which has been designed and experimentally validated for benchmark control algorithms for underwater vehicles. The BlueROV2 model is based on Fossen's equations and includes a kinematic model of the vehicle, the hydrodynamics of vehicle and water interaction, a dynamic model of the thrusters, and, lastly, the gravitational/buoyant forces. The hydrodynamic parameters and thruster model have been validated in a test facility. The benchmark model also includes the ocean current, modeled as constant velocity. The tether connecting the ROV to the top-site facility has been modeled using the lumped mass method and is implemented as a force input to the ROV model. At last, to show the usefulness of the benchmark model, a case study is presented where a BlueROV2 is deployed to inspect an offshore monopile structure. The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error. It is concluded that the simulator establishes a benchmark for future control schemes for position control and trajectory tracking under the influence of environmental disturbances.},

  abstract = {When designing a motion planner for autonomous robots there are usually multiple objectives to be considered. However, a cost function that yields the desired trade-off between objectives is not easily obtainable. A common technique across many applications is to use a weighted sum of relevant objective functions and then carefully adapt the weights. However, this approach may not find all relevant trade-offs even in simple planning problems. Thus, we study an alternative method based on a weighted maximum of objectives. Such a cost function is more expressive than the weighted sum, and we show how it can be deployed in both continuous- and discrete-space motion planning problems. We propose a novel path planning algorithm for the proposed cost function and establish its correctness, and present heuristic adaptations that yield a practical runtime. In extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed cost function and algorithm are able to find a wider range of tradeoffs between objectives (i.e., Pareto-optimal solutions) for various planning problems, showcasing its advantages in practice.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly important for different types of industrial applications. The generally high cost of AUVs restricts the access to them and therefore advances in research and technological development. However, recent advances have led to lower cost commercially available Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which present a platform that can be enhanced to enable a high degree of autonomy, similar to that of a high-end AUV. In this article, we present how a low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf ROV can be used as a foundation for developing versatile and affordable AUVs. We introduce the required hardware modifications to obtain a system capable of autonomous operations as well as the necessary software modules. Additionally, we present a set of use cases exhibiting the versatility of the developed platform for intervention and mapping tasks.},

  abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have a wide variety of applications in the marine domain, including exploration, surveying, and mapping. Their navigation systems rely heavily on fusing data from inertial sensors and a Doppler velocity log (DVL), typically via nonlinear filtering. The DVL estimates the AUV's velocity vector by transmitting acoustic beams to the seabed and analyzing the Doppler shift from the reflected signals. However, due to environmental challenges, DVL beams can deflect or fail in real-world settings, causing signal outages. In such cases, the AUV relies solely on inertial data, leading to accumulated navigation errors and mission terminations. To cope with these outages, we adopted ST-BeamsNet, a deep learning approach that uses inertial readings and prior DVL data to estimate AUV velocity during isolated outages. In this work, we extend ST-BeamsNet to address prolonged DVL outages and evaluate its impact within an extended Kalman filter framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves velocity RMSE by up to 63\% and reduces final position error by up to 95\% compared to pure inertial navigation. This is in scenarios involving up to 50 seconds of complete DVL outage.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the terrain-following problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from control perspectives with full consideration of terrain characteristics. By equipping the AUV with three simple single-beam echo sounders, a set of precise along-track bottom slopes are obtained in a real-time manner, and the occurrence of the lost bottom lock phenomenon caused by a single sonar altimeter is eliminated. A slope-based data processing method is developed, which enables an AUV to characterize seafloor features with complementary sensing modalities to generate proper adaptive height-modified values. In order to keep a fixed height when maneuvering over rugged terrains, a back-stepping depth control is implemented by adjusting horizontal rudder angle, and Lyapunov theory is adopted to analyze the asymptotic stability of the resulting terrain-following control system. At last, simulation results indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology with a discussion of various sensor configurations.},
