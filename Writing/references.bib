  abstract = {This thesis addresses the subject of formation control of underwater vehicles, using either inter-vehicle relative position measurements or range-only measurements. The work is motivated by the MORPH project, aiming to use formations of vehicles with complementary capabilities to map the underwater environment in challenging conditions. The problem studied is that of driving a vehicle (follower) to an appropriately defined position with respect to another vehicle (leader), which moves along an unknown trajectory. This control task is divided into two steps. Firstly, a trajectory-tracking controller is designed, so that a follower vehicle can track a specified virtual target. Conditions under which the tracking error converges to zero or remains bounded are derived using tools from nonlinear systems theory. Secondly, we design path-generators that provide the position and velocity of the virtual target to be tracked, for both the relative position measurements and the range-only measurements scenarios. These path-generation strategies take into account the formation objectives, typical maneuver geometries and limitations of underwater inter-vehicle communications. Applications envisioned in the scope of the MORPH project are presented and discussed. The implementation of the strategies proposed for formation control with relative position measurements is described, taking explicitly into account the filter architectures required for relative vehicle navigation. Finally, results of simulations and sea trials are shown, with position errors generally below 1 m in MORPH trials in Lisbon and the Azores.},

  abstract = {The problem of high-precision bottom-following in the proximity of the seabed for open-frame unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is addressed in this paper. The suggested approach consists of the integration of a guidance and control system with an active multi-hypothesis extended Kalman "lter, able to estimate the motion of the vehicle with respect to the bottom pro"le. The guidance module is based on the de"nition of a suitable Lyapunov function associated with the bottom-following task, while the motion controller is a conventional autopilot, performing autoheading, autodepth, and autospeed. The motion of the vehicle is estimated from range and bearing measurements supplied by a high-frequency pencil-beam pro"ling sonar. Moreover, a general-purpose sensor-based guidance and control system for advanced UUVs, able to manage active sensing-based guidance and motion estimation modules, is presented. An application of the proposed architecture to execute high-precision bottom-following using Romeo, a prototype UUV, developed by the Robotics Dept. of the Istituto Automazione Navale, is described. Experimental results of tests, conducted in a high-diving pool with the vehicle equipped with a sonar pro"ler, are presented. ( 1999 Published by Elsevier Science {\c}td. All rights reserved.},
