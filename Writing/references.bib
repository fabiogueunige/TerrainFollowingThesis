  abstract = {The problem of high-precision bottom-following in the proximity of the seabed for open-frame unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is addressed in this paper. The suggested approach consists of the integration of a guidance and control system with an active multi-hypothesis extended Kalman "lter, able to estimate the motion of the vehicle with respect to the bottom pro"le. The guidance module is based on the de"nition of a suitable Lyapunov function associated with the bottom-following task, while the motion controller is a conventional autopilot, performing autoheading, autodepth, and autospeed. The motion of the vehicle is estimated from range and bearing measurements supplied by a high-frequency pencil-beam pro"ling sonar. Moreover, a general-purpose sensor-based guidance and control system for advanced UUVs, able to manage active sensing-based guidance and motion estimation modules, is presented. An application of the proposed architecture to execute high-precision bottom-following using Romeo, a prototype UUV, developed by the Robotics Dept. of the Istituto Automazione Navale, is described. Experimental results of tests, conducted in a high-diving pool with the vehicle equipped with a sonar pro"ler, are presented. ( 1999 Published by Elsevier Science {\c}td. All rights reserved.},
